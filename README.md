# Awesome Presentations in Svelte and RevealJs

This project is an experiment with using Svelte and reveal.js to create stunning presentations. Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces, and reveal.js is a powerful tool for creating presentations using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Use Svelte's component-based architecture to create reusable presentation elements.
- Leverage reveal.js's features for slide transitions, animations, and layouts.
- Easily customize the look and feel of your presentations using CSS.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/MrMDrX/Presentations-in-Svelte.git`
2. Install dependencies: `cd Presentations-in-Svelte && npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to view your presentation.

## Usage
